Files included:

  - files/FrankProto_Bio_full.pdf  (placeholder - replace with real PDFs)
  - files/FrankProto_Bio_short.pdf (placeholder)
  - README.txt

How to preview locally:
  - Open index.html in your browser (double-click). For best preview on mobile, use devtools device toolbar.

How to publish on GitHub Pages (simple method):
  1. Create a GitHub account if you don't have one: https://github.com
  2. Create a new repository (e.g., frankproto-site). You can make it public.
  3. Upload the contents of this folder (use the "Add files" -> "Upload files" button) OR use Git on your machine to push.
  4. In the repository, go to Settings -> Pages (or "Pages" in the left menu).
  5. Under "Build and deployment", choose "Deploy from a branch", set "Branch" to 'main' and folder to '/ (root)', then Save.
  6. After a minute, GitHub will publish the site at: https://<your-username>.github.io/<repo>/
  7. To use frankproto.com, buy the domain at your registrar and follow GitHub's docs to set a custom domain (you'll add A/ALIAS records or CNAME as instructed).

How to replace the placeholder image and PDFs:
  - Replace files/images/frank-proto.jpg with the actual headshot (same filename) to keep links intact.
  - Replace files/FrankProto_Bio_full.pdf and files/FrankProto_Bio_short.pdf with the real PDFs.

If you want me to push this to a GitHub repo for you, I can prepare the exact files and give you step-by-step commands. If you'd prefer FTP upload to an existing host, I can provide FTP instructions instead.
