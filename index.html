        <h2>Biography</h2>
        <p>
          Frank Proto began piano studies at age seven and took up the double bass at sixteen while at the High School of Performing Arts in New York City. After graduating he attended the Manhattan School of Music where he earned bachelor's and master's degrees.

        <p>
          As a student of David Walter, Frank performed the first solo double bass recital in the history of the school. Unable to find a contemporary American-style work for his graduation recital in 1963, he composed his own piece — <em>Sonata 1963 for Double Bass and Piano</em> — his first composition.
        </p>

          During the 1960s he freelanced in New York, playing with the Symphony of the Air, American Symphony, Broadway shows and jazz clubs. In 1966 he joined the Cincinnati Symphony Orchestra, where he developed as a composer and was appointed Composer-in-Residence in 1972.
